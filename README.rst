django-rest_api
======

Rebase django Class Based Views on a RESTful core

Requirements
============

* Django 1.3+

Installation
============

``sudo python setup.py install`` 

Usage
=====

You shouldn't use this.  You should use Django Rest Framework.  I wrote this because the project needed to 
ensure complete control over the output, HTTP verb usage, etc when interacting with a poor HTTP client.
